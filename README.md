## Practice utilizing cloning of repos to VS Code

### Define reusable functions to create a series of project folders.
### Each function should have a clear purpose, input parameters, and return values if applicable.
### Include a docstring for each function to describe its behavior.
### Use for in range(), for in list, and while loops to demonstrate different looping techniques.
### Use a list comprehension to demonstrate transforming a list into a new list.
### Use conditional branching to demonstrate different folder creation options, such as including options to force lowercase or remove spaces.
### Specific functions to implement and the technique to demonstrate.

- Function 1. For item in Range: Create a function to generate folders for a given range (e.g., years).
- Function 2. For Item in List: Develop a function to create folders from a list of names.
- Function 3. List Comprehension: Create a function to create prefixed folders by transforming a list of names and combining each with a prefix (e.g., "data-").
- Function 4. While Loop: Write a function to create folders periodically (e.g., one folder every 5 seconds).
